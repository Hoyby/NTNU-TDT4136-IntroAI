Lecture 4: (A* and) Local search

admissable
consistent

## Local search
4 queen problem

Low space complexity

State space landscape

Hill climbing

Belief state

## Adviserial search

MiniMax Algorithm

Alpha and Beta Pruning (doubles solvable depth)

Cutoff-test (depth limit)

Eval function:
heuristic estimation for desired state

# Constraint Satisfaction Problems

Important in AI: representation and reasoning

Search, inference.
Constraints, eg sudoku
Preferences (soft constrains)
